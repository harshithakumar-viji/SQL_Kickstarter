Lately, I have been undergoing a bootcamp and have completed the first few parts of the bootcamp, which is the final project 
for the SQL material.
In this project, the product team is considering launching a campaign on Kickstarter to test the viability of some offerings. 
We were asked to pull data that will help the team understand what might influence the success of a campaign.
Questions to be answered are:
  *What types of projects are most likely to be successful?
  *Which projects fail?
